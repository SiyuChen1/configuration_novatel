# Use the SETINSTRANSLATION command to specify translational offsets between the IMU frame and other
# reference frames, including GNSS antennas or the desired output frame.
# ANT1: Offset from the IMU center of navigation to the phase center of the primary GNSS antenna.
# ANT2: Offset from the IMU center of navigation to the phase center of the secondary GNSS antenna.
# X, Y, Z Translation: 0.431 0.0 0.013
# X, Y, Z Translation Standard Deviation: 0.001 0.001 0.001
# For the ANT1, ANT2, EXTERNAL and GIMBAL translations, the standard deviation defaults are set to 10% of the translation value (up to a max of 10 metres).

# https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/PDFs/OEM7_Commands_Logs_Manual.pdf page 1098
# The CORRIMUS log contains the raw IMU data corrected for gravity, the earth’s rotation and estimated sensor errors.
# logs contains angular rate and acceleration

log insattxa ontime 0.01
# outputs the attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) with respect to the vehicle body frame or user output frame
# in the local level frame
# https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/PDFs/OEM7_Commands_Logs_Manual.pdf page 1110
# problem 1: definition of roll, pitch, yaw is not consistent with the convention
# problem 2: rotaion oder is not clear, but probably is fixed axes

# outputs the quaternion with respect to the vehicle body frame or user output frame
# in the local level frame
# https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/PDFs/OEM7_Commands_Logs_Manual.pdf page 1112
# same as log insattxa ontime 0.01
# but output is not in roll, pitch, yaw but in quaternion

log bestgnsspos ontime 0.1
# https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/PDFs/OEM7_Commands_Logs_Manual.pdf page 1090
# BESTGNSSPOS always outputs positions at the antenna phase center.
# This log contains the best available GNSS position (without INS) computed by the receiver.
# if the system operating in an RTK mode, after 60 second period, the position is the best position computed by the last base station observations.
# if the system is not operating in an RTK mode, only pseudorange differential solutions
